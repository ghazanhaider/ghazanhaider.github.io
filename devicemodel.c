device is usually embedded in more specific devices. 

struct device
- parent device
- kobj 
- device_type
- bus
- device_driver
- platform_data				/* Platform specific data, device core doesn't touch it */
- driver_data 				/* Driver data, set and get with dev_set_drvdata/dev_get_drvdata */
- dev_pin_info 				/* pinctrl *pins ? */
- of_node 
- knode_class 				/* The node used to add the device to the class list.*/


So spi_device will include struct device and its members will be spi.dev.platform_data etc.
platform_device also includes struct device 

ssc_device points to platform_device:
ssc_device->pdev 

Therefore ssc_devices dev data is inheritied from platform_device.dev.


struct driver
- name 
- bus_type
- ops 

A driver can be associated with a device, a bus or a class







/**
 * struct device - The basic device structure
 * @parent:	The device's "parent" device, the device to which it is attached.
 * 		In most cases, a parent device is some sort of bus or host
 * 		controller. If parent is NULL, the device, is a top-level device,
 * 		which is not usually what you want.
 * @p:		Holds the private data of the driver core portions of the device.
 * 		See the comment of the struct device_private for detail.
 * @kobj:	A top-level, abstract class from which other classes are derived.
 * @init_name:	Initial name of the device.
 * @type:	The type of device.
 * 		This identifies the device type and carries type-specific
 * 		information.
 * @mutex:	Mutex to synchronize calls to its driver.
 * @bus:	Type of bus device is on.
 * @driver:	Which driver has allocated this
 * @platform_data: Platform data specific to the device.
 * 		Example: For devices on custom boards, as typical of embedded
 * 		and SOC based hardware, Linux often uses platform_data to point
 * 		to board-specific structures describing devices and how they
 * 		are wired.  That can include what ports are available, chip
 * 		variants, which GPIO pins act in what additional roles, and so
 * 		on.  This shrinks the "Board Support Packages" (BSPs) and
 * 		minimizes board-specific #ifdefs in drivers.
 * @driver_data: Private pointer for driver specific info.
 * @links:	Links to suppliers and consumers of this device.
 * @power:	For device power management.
 *		See Documentation/driver-api/pm/devices.rst for details.
 * @pm_domain:	Provide callbacks that are executed during system suspend,
 * 		hibernation, system resume and during runtime PM transitions
 * 		along with subsystem-level and driver-level callbacks.
 * @em_pd:	device's energy model performance domain
 * @pins:	For device pin management.
 *		See Documentation/driver-api/pin-control.rst for details.
 * @msi:	MSI related data
 * @numa_node:	NUMA node this device is close to.
 * @dma_ops:    DMA mapping operations for this device.
 * @dma_mask:	Dma mask (if dma'ble device).
 * @coherent_dma_mask: Like dma_mask, but for alloc_coherent mapping as not all
 * 		hardware supports 64-bit addresses for consistent allocations
 * 		such descriptors.
 * @bus_dma_limit: Limit of an upstream bridge or bus which imposes a smaller
 *		DMA limit than the device itself supports.
 * @dma_range_map: map for DMA memory ranges relative to that of RAM
 * @dma_parms:	A low level driver may set these to teach IOMMU code about
 * 		segment limitations.
 * @dma_pools:	Dma pools (if dma'ble device).
 * @dma_mem:	Internal for coherent mem override.
 * @cma_area:	Contiguous memory area for dma allocations
 * @dma_io_tlb_mem: Pointer to the swiotlb pool used.  Not for driver use.
 * @archdata:	For arch-specific additions.
 * @of_node:	Associated device tree node.
 * @fwnode:	Associated device node supplied by platform firmware.
 * @devt:	For creating the sysfs "dev".
 * @id:		device instance
 * @devres_lock: Spinlock to protect the resource of the device.
 * @devres_head: The resources list of the device.
 * @knode_class: The node used to add the device to the class list.
 * @class:	The class of the device.
 * @groups:	Optional attribute groups.
 * @release:	Callback to free the device after all references have
 * 		gone away. This should be set by the allocator of the
 * 		device (i.e. the bus driver that discovered the device).
 * @iommu_group: IOMMU group the device belongs to.
 * @iommu:	Per device generic IOMMU runtime data
 * @physical_location: Describes physical location of the device connection
 *		point in the system housing.
 * @removable:  Whether the device can be removed from the system. This
 *              should be set by the subsystem / bus driver that discovered
 *              the device.
 *
 * @offline_disabled: If set, the device is permanently online.
 * @offline:	Set after successful invocation of bus type's .offline().
 * @of_node_reused: Set if the device-tree node is shared with an ancestor
 *              device.
 * @state_synced: The hardware state of this device has been synced to match
 *		  the software state of this device by calling the driver/bus
 *		  sync_state() callback.
 * @can_match:	The device has matched with a driver at least once or it is in
 *		a bus (like AMBA) which can't check for matching drivers until
 *		other devices probe successfully.
 * @dma_coherent: this particular device is dma coherent, even if the
 *		architecture supports non-coherent devices.
 * @dma_ops_bypass: If set to %true then the dma_ops are bypassed for the
 *		streaming DMA operations (->map_* / ->unmap_* / ->sync_*),
 *		and optionall (if the coherent mask is large enough) also
 *		for dma allocations.  This flag is managed by the dma ops
 *		instance from ->dma_supported.
 *
 * At the lowest level, every device in a Linux system is represented by an
 * instance of struct device. The device structure contains the information
 * that the device model core needs to model the system. Most subsystems,
 * however, track additional information about the devices they host. As a
 * result, it is rare for devices to be represented by bare device structures;
 * instead, that structure, like kobject structures, is usually embedded within
 * a higher-level representation of the device.

 * @sync_state:	Called to sync device state to software state after all the

/**
 * struct spi_device - Controller side proxy for an SPI slave device
 * @dev: Driver model representation of the device.
 * @controller: SPI controller used with the device.
 * @master: Copy of controller, for backwards compatibility.
 * @max_speed_hz: Maximum clock rate to be used with this chip
 *	(on this board); may be changed by the device's driver.
 *	The spi_transfer.speed_hz can override this for each transfer.
 * @chip_select: Chipselect, distinguishing chips handled by @controller.
 * @mode: The spi mode defines how data is clocked out and in.
 *	This may be changed by the device's driver.
 *	The "active low" default for chipselect mode can be overridden
 *	(by specifying SPI_CS_HIGH) as can the "MSB first" default for
 *	each word in a transfer (by specifying SPI_LSB_FIRST).
 * @bits_per_word: Data transfers involve one or more words; word sizes
 *	like eight or 12 bits are common.  In-memory wordsizes are
 *	powers of two bytes (e.g. 20 bit samples use 32 bits).
 *	This may be changed by the device's driver, or left at the
 *	default (0) indicating protocol words are eight bit bytes.
 *	The spi_transfer.bits_per_word can override this for each transfer.
 * @rt: Make the pump thread real time priority.
 * @irq: Negative, or the number passed to request_irq() to receive
 *	interrupts from this device.
 * @controller_state: Controller's runtime state
 * @controller_data: Board-specific definitions for controller, such as
 *	FIFO initialization parameters; from board_info.controller_data
 * @modalias: Name of the driver to use with this device, or an alias
 *	for that name.  This appears in the sysfs "modalias" attribute
 *	for driver coldplugging, and in uevents used for hotplugging
 * @driver_override: If the name of a driver is written to this attribute, then
 *	the device will bind to the named driver and only the named driver.
 *	Do not set directly, because core frees it; use driver_set_override() to
 *	set or clear it.
 * @cs_gpiod: gpio descriptor of the chipselect line (optional, NULL when
 *	not using a GPIO line)
 * @word_delay: delay to be inserted between consecutive
 *	words of a transfer
 * @cs_setup: delay to be introduced by the controller after CS is asserted
 * @cs_hold: delay to be introduced by the controller before CS is deasserted
 * @cs_inactive: delay to be introduced by the controller after CS is
 *	deasserted. If @cs_change_delay is used from @spi_transfer, then the
 *	two delays will be added up.
 * @pcpu_statistics: statistics for the spi_device
 *
 * A @spi_device is used to interchange data between an SPI slave
 * (usually a discrete chip) and CPU memory.
 *
 * In @dev, the platform_data is used to hold information about this
 * device that's meaningful to the device's protocol driver, but not
 * to its controller.  One example might be an identifier for a chip
 * variant with slightly different functionality; another might be
 * information about how this particular board wires the chip's pins.
